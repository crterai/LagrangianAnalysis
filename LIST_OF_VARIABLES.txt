# Lists out the variables needed to accomplish the analysis


Variables with an hourly output frequency
Local time
Total cloud cover
Height-resolved cloud cover
LWP
SST
Height-resolved temperature and humidity (for estimating inversion height and strength)
Height-resolved vertical velocity (omega)
Lower troposphere horizontal winds (or at the surface?)
Surface precipitation rate (do I need something more height resolved?)
Cloud droplet number concentration (to retrieve cloud top Nd)
