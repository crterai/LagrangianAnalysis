# Lists out the variables needed to accomplish the analysis


Variables with an hourly output frequency
Local time
Total cloud cover
Height-resolved cloud cover
LWP (in-cloud and total grid)
SST
Height-resolved temperature and humidity (for estimating inversion height and strength, 700hPa humidity, lower tropospheric stability)
Height-resolved vertical velocity (omega)
Lower troposphere horizontal winds (at 925hPa)
10-m wind speeds
Surface precipitation rate
Height resolved cloud droplet number concentration (to retrieve cloud top Nd)
