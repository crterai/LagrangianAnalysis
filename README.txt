A workflow outline and the list of files in this directory that are written to apply Ryan Eastman's analysis of the evolution of observational cloud fields to climate model output. 

Workflow

Calculate appropriate variables for diagnosis
1)BLH, entraining qv, radiative qv, EIS, LTS -- test_run.py, create_SPNC_CAM5.py, create_variables.py

Initializing boxes
1) Determine boxes that fall within study area -- 
2) Determine snapshots 0130 or 1330 local time
3) Create boxes to track forward

Running trajectories
1) Read in U,V @ 925 hPa every Xhrs and push boxes forward
2) Locate box after 24hrs

Analyze the before and after 
1)Calculate anomalies with respect to 100 day running mean at each grid box -- analysis_lib.py
2) Bin/categorize data by initial X -- analysis_lib.py


The list of files and brief descriptions follow below:
LIST_OF_VARIABLES.txt - includes a list of variables needed for the analysis
trajectories.py - calculates trajectories of the boxes based on gridded U and V fields
subset_data.py - creates subsets and boxes that fall within the study area (lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1) and determines which time snapshot to initialize the boxes based on the mean latitude and longitude
analysis_lib.py - includes functions for analysis and includes a function that calculates the anomalies of a field with respect to 100 day running mean at each grid box
create_variables.py - includes functions that create relevant 2D variables based on 3D variables (e.g. U,V at 925hPa, cloud top T, BLH from cloud top T minus SST, 
create_netcdfs.py - includes functions that add metadata to the netcdfs when creating datasets
